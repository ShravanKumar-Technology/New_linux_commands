* A "commit" is a group of saved changes to git repository, impacts history, and is uniquly identified by sha1 hash.

* Branch is timeline for commits, master is main branch and default branch.

* Head is pointer to last commit.


git push -u origin master
#pushesh all changes in file to remote repository. -u is used when first file is pushed.


---------------------------------------
good practice.

git pull origin master
* it is good practice to pull and merge remote repository and checking for any changes before pushing your update.

git push origin master
* too update any changes made by you to remote repository.
---------------------------------------


* working directory( init) ----> local staging area(add)---> git repository(commit)----> push ---> remote directory(github). 


* git help # to get help.

* A separate file called .gitignore has to be created and that file can be used to contain file names ( one file name per line ) which would to ignored from  adding to git repository. ex:- add *.log to ignore files with log extension. You have to commit .gitignore file.
